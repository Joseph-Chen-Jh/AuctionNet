# Overview
This is an auto-bidding strategy training module to help users implement and evaluate their bidding strategies. This framework includes three modules: data processing, strategy training, and offline evaluation. Several industry-proven baseline strategies, such as reinforcement learning-based bidding, online linear programming-based bidding and generative models, are included in the framework. Users can utilize this framework to develop a well-trained auto-bidding strategy based on the training dataset. Users can also rely on the provided framework for a basic offline assessment to evaluate the strategy.




## Data Processing
Download the raw data on ad opportunities granularity and place it in the biddingTrainENv/data/ folder.
The directory structure under data should be:
```
NeurIPS_Auto_Bidding_General_Track_Baseline
|── data
    |── traffic
        |── period-7.csv
        |── period-8.csv
        |── period-9.csv
        |── period-10.csv
        |── period-11.csv
        |── period-12.csv
        |── period-13.csv
        |── period-14.csv
        |── period-15.csv
        |── period-16.csv
        |── period-17.csv
        |── period-18.csv
        |── period-19.csv
        |── period-20.csv
        |── period-21.csv
        |── period-22.csv
        |── period-23.csv
        |── period-24.csv
        |── period-25.csv
        |── period-26.csv
        |── period-27.csv
        
```

Run this script to convert the raw data on ad opportunities granularity into trajectory data required for model training.
```

```
python main/main_bc.py 
```
Use the BcBiddingStrategy as the PlayerBiddingStrategy for evaluation.
```
bidding_train_env/strategy/__init__.py
from .bc_bidding_strategy import BcBiddingStrategy as PlayerBiddingStrategy
```

#### BCQ  Model
Load the training data and train the BCQ bidding strategy.
```
python main/main_bcq.py
